Controls:
- Pitch, roll, and yaw response should be proportional to airflow speed over
  control surfaces

Handling:
- Thrust should account for inertia when rolling from standstill


Flight Data required:
- Pitch angle (relative to ground)
- Roll angle (relative to ground
- Yaw angle (relative to direction of travel)

- Ground speed (relative to flat ground)
- Airspeed (relative to RAF)
- Angle of attack (to relative airflow)

Flight data constants:
- Aircraft weight
- Aircraft max speed
- Max AoA (stalling AoA)
- CoG position
- CoP position
- Drag factor (Estimation of overall form drag etc)

Aircraft logic components:
- Input (Capture user input)
- Flight controller (Orchestrate flight logic)
- Flight data (Capture data points)
- Flight model (Handle aerodynamic / drag forces)
- Engines (Handle thrust forces)
- Wheels (Handle wheel colliders / steering / braking)


Test cases for play test:
- AC should not be able to pitch / roll / yaw while stationary on the ground
- AC control effectiveness should be less effective at low speed (i.e. in the flare)
- AC should be able to fly upside down briefly without breaking everything
- AC should be able to fly vertically up / down with realistic handling
- AoA should be correctly calculated from RAF (test using steep flight path)
- AC should stall if max AoA exceeded
- Lift should act through CoP, weight should act through CoG. When engine is cut, nose should drop.
- AC speed should decrease in steep climb
- AC speed should increase in steep dive
