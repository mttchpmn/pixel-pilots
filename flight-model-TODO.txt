Controls:
- Pitch, roll, and yaw reponse should be proportional to airflow speed over
  control surfaces

Handling:
- Thrust should account for inertia when rolling from standstill


Flight Data required:
- Pitch angle (relative to ground)
- Roll angle (relative to ground
- Yaw angle (relative to direction of travel)

- Ground speed (relative to flat ground)
- Airspeed (relative to RAF)
- Angle of attack (to relative airflow)

Aircraft logic components:
- Input (Capture user input)
- Flight controller (Orchestrate flight logic)
- Flight data (Capture data points)
- Flight model (Handle aerodynamic / drag forces)
- Engines (Handle thrust forces)
- Wheels (Handle wheel colliders / steering?)
